            <h1>WATER POLLUTION</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p class="con">When we think of water pollution, we might envision rivers and lakes being filled with trash and debris, or perhaps an oil spill that washes up on shore. But water pollution goes beyond these things: it can also be caused by agricultural runoff from fertilizer or pesticides, as well as by untreated sewage from cities.
                <br>
                The effects of water pollution are far-reaching. People who drink polluted water may develop respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia; others may develop skin irritation or rashes due to exposure to toxic chemicals in the air. The environment itself can be damaged by water pollution—for example, fish die offs due to toxic algae blooms often result from polluted waterways.
                <br>
                Water pollution is a growing problem due to the increase of waste in our oceans. The ocean is an essential part of life for humans, animals and plants. It provides us with food, oxygen, water and shelter. Pollution in the form of sewage and garbage can lead to diseases such as gastroenteritis, cholera and typhoid fever.
                <br>
                The world's oceans are already polluted with plastic bags, bottles, packaging and other forms of waste that are used once then thrown away into the ocean. This causes an increase in weight on sea turtles' shells which makes it difficult for them to swim or dive underwater causing them to drown as they struggle against their weight while trying to escape predators like sharks or even plastic bags themselves! 
                <br>
                It has been estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This means that over time we will lose many species of marine animals completely because they cannot survive without oxygen from fish breathing through their gills which are made from algae living inside their bodies!
